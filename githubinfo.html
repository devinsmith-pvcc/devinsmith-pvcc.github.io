<h1>All About GitHub</h1>
<ul><table>
    <h2>Q. What is a version control system?</h2>
    <h2>A. also known as source control or revision control - is an important software development practice for tracking and managing changes made to code and other files. It is closely related to source code management.</h2>
</table></ul>
<ul><table>
    <h2>Q. What is Git?</h2>
    <h2>A. Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development</h2>
</table></ul>
<ul><table>
    <h2>Q. What is GitHub?</h2>
    <h2>A. GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.</h2>
</table></ul>
<ul><table>
    <h2>Q. What is the differance between Git and GitHub?</h2>
    <h2>A. Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.</h2>
</table></ul>
<ul><table>
    <h2>Q. Who started GitHub and how was it started?</h2>
    <h2>A. The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008</h2>

    <h2>Git/GitHub terms:</h2>
        <li><h3>Repository:A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Commit: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Fork: A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Push: To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Pull Requests: Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Workflows: A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Issues: Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion thread. You can also categorize an issue with labels and assign it to someone.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Raw Button: Enter raw view, with the raw view, you can view or copy the raw content of a file without any styling.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Blame Button: This is used to examine the contents of a file line by line and see when each line was last modified and who the author of the modifications was.</h3></li>
